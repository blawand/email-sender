          <div class="google-policy-emphasis">
            <p>
              <strong>Limited Use of Google User Data:</strong> Notwithstanding
              anything else in this Privacy Policy, the Google User Data
              accessed by the Service (specifically the permission to send
              emails via the Gmail API) is used *solely* to provide the core
              email sending functionality initiated by You within the SendSuite
              application. We do not use this access to read your emails, send
              emails not initiated by you through the app interface, or for any
              other purpose not directly related to the Service's explicit
              functionality. This data is not used for advertising purposes.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Storage of Personal Data</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Account Information (Email Address):</strong> Your email
            address, obtained via Google OAuth, is stored securely to manage
            your session and identify you as a user.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Email Content, Recipients, Attachments:</strong> Data you
            provide for sending emails (subject, body, recipients from manual
            input or CSV, attachments) is processed temporarily by the Service
            solely to facilitate the sending operation via the Gmail API. This
            data is typically not stored persistently on Our servers after the
            send operation is completed or fails, except potentially in
            temporary logs for debugging or error analysis, which are securely
            managed and regularly purged. We do not build profiles based on this
            content.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Google OAuth Tokens:</strong> Secure tokens required to
            maintain your connection to Google and send emails are stored
            securely using industry-standard practices. These tokens are
            specific to the permissions you grant (sending email) and do not
            grant Us broader access to your account.
          </p>

          <h3>Sharing Your Personal Data</h3>
          <p>We do not sell Your Personal Data, including Google User Data.</p>
          <p>
            We may share Your Personal Data in the following limited situations:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>With Google:</strong> To interact with the Gmail API for
              sending emails as You direct, based on the permissions You
              granted.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We may use third-party
              Service Providers for hosting, infrastructure, and monitoring
              purposes (e.g., Render for hosting). These providers process data
              on Our behalf under strict confidentiality agreements and do not
              have permission to use Your Personal Data, especially Google User
              Data, for their own purposes. They are only permitted to access
              data necessary to perform their specific functions for Us.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>For Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose Your
              Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid
              requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government
              agency), but only to the extent required and legally permissible.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>For Security and Abuse Prevention:</strong> We may share
              information if necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action
              regarding potential policy violations, suspected fraud, situations
              involving potential threats to the safety of any person, or as
              evidence in litigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If the Company is involved in
              a merger, acquisition or asset sale, Your Personal Data may be
              transferred. We will provide notice before Your Personal Data is
              transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.
              Google User Data transfers will comply with Google's policies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may disclose Your Personal
              Data for any other purpose with Your explicit consent.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We will *not* share Your Google User Data with affiliates, business
            partners, advertisers, data brokers, or other third parties except
            under the specific, limited circumstances described above (primarily
            for service provision, security, legal compliance, or with your
            consent).
          </p>

          <h3>Retention of Your Personal Data</h3>
          <p>
            The Company will retain Your Personal Data only for as long as is
            necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will
            retain and use Your Personal Data (like your email address for
            account management) to the extent necessary to provide the service,
            comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required
            to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve
            disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. Temporary
            data like email content for sending is retained only as long as
            needed for the operation and associated logging (see Storage
            section).
          </p>
          <p>
            Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time for
            analysis purposes, except when this data is needed to strengthen the
            security, improve the functionality of Our Service, or We are
            legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.
          </p>

          <h3>Transfer of Your Personal Data</h3>
          <p>
            Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the
            Company's operating offices (conceptually) and potentially on
            servers provided by hosting Service Providers (e.g., Render) located
            in various jurisdictions. This means that this information may be
            transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of
            Your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction
            where the data protection laws may differ than those from Your
            jurisdiction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of
            such information represents Your agreement to that transfer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that
            Your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy
            Policy (including compliance with Google's policies for Google User
            Data) and no transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to an
            organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in
            place including the security of Your data and other personal
            information.
          </p>

          <h3>Delete Your Personal Data</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to delete or request that We assist in deleting
            the Personal Data that We have collected about You.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can revoke SendSuite's access to your Google Account at any time
            via your Google Account security settings page (<a
              href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >https://myaccount.google.com/permissions</a
            >). Revoking access will prevent the Service from sending further
            emails and effectively deletes the access tokens We hold.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may request the deletion of your stored account information
            (your email address) by contacting Us using the details below. Upon
            request, we will delete this information, provided we do not have a
            legal obligation or overriding legitimate basis to retain it.

          <p>
            Please note, however, that We may need to retain certain information
            (like logs related to legal compliance or security investigations)
            when we have a legal obligation or lawful basis to do so, even after
            access revocation or account deletion request.

          <h3>Security of Your Personal Data</h3>
          <p>
            The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us. We use Google
            OAuth 2.0 for authentication, meaning We never see or store Your
            Google password. We implement administrative, technical, and
            physical security measures designed to protect your data from
            unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. This
            includes using secure connections (HTTPS) for data transmission and
            secure storage practices for sensitive information like OAuth
            tokens.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet,
            or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to
            use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We
            cannot guarantee its absolute security.
          </p>
